Yelp API Assignment

Create a site with a search bar and a list of Philadelphia neighborhoods and/or towns and cities in the metro region. These can be listed in a dropdown menu or just as a collection of buttons/divs. There should also be a button or div that when clicked runs a function that: 

-  Searches the Yelp API for businesses in the selected neighborhood that match the search criteria from the search bar. 
- Lists the results on the page with some of the data associated with each result (name, address, image, etc.)

Additionally: 

- When a result is clicked, it opens the Yelp page for that business in a new window.
- When a user makes a new search, the old results go away and the new results  populate the page and are also clickable.

Use SASS and the forEach loop instead of the for loop.

EXTRA!

Create functionality so that a user can "save" results and make more searches. A user can continue "saving" those results and view all of the saved results.

When a user clicks on a result, instead of opening that result in a new tab, pop up a modal with that business' more specific information.
